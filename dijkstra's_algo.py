#dijkstra's algo can be applied only to graphs with non-negative weights
"""
Why priority queue in Dijkstra?
In BFS, we process nodes level by level.

But in Dijkstra, we always want to process the node with the currently known smallest distance â€” this is why we use a priority queue (min-heap via heapq).
that is why its also called a greedy algorithm.
